# customer_shopping_behaviour_analysis_project
Customer Behavior Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data to uncover insights that support strategic business decisions. The process starts with data loading and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), database integration, SQL-based analysis, and visualization via Power BI. The final deliverables include a comprehensive report and an AI-generated presentation.

Dataset
The dataset contains customer transaction records across various product categories. It includes purchase details such as product types, quantities, prices, and subscription information. The data was loaded and preprocessed in Python.

Tools Used
Python: Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis

MySQL: Storing and querying transaction data for detailed customer behavior insights

Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations

Gamma AI: Automating the creation of a presentation based on the analysis

Jupyter Notebook: Code development and documentation

Steps
Data Loading: Imported dataset into Python for initial inspection

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, patterns, and key metrics in the data

Database Integration: Loaded cleaned data into MySQL for efficient querying

Customer Behavior Analysis: Used SQL queries to segment customers, analyze spending habits, and study subscription behavior

Dashboard Creation: Connected MySQL data to Power BI to build interactive visual dashboards

Reporting: Compiled findings and insights in a detailed report

Presentation: Leveraged Gamma AI to generate a professional presentation summarizing the project

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive charts and graphs illustrating customer segments, spending trends, product preferences, and subscription metrics to enable data-driven decision-making.

Results
The analysis revealed distinct customer segments, spending patterns, and subscription behaviors. These insights provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing and product strategy optimization.
